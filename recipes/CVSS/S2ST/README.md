# Speech-to-Speech Translation (with CVSS)
This folder contains the recipes for training speech-to-unit translation model with the CVSS dataset.
CVSS is a massively multilingual-to-English speech-to-speech translation corpus, covering pairs from 21 languages into English. CVSS is derived from the Common Voice speech corpus and the CoVoST 2 speech-to-text translation corpus.

To train the unit-based HiFi-GAN vocoder, please refer to the LJSpeech/S2ST recipe.

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here:
https://github.com/google-research-datasets/cvss

## Installing Extra Dependencies
Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

## How to run
To train the S2UT model on French-English, simply run the following command:
```
python train.py hparams/train_fr-en.yaml --src_data_folder=/corpus/CV4/fr --tgt_data_folder=/corpus/CV4/fr-en --bfloat16_mix_prec
```

>  Dynamic batch settings are optimized for a 40GB VRAM GPU. Don't hesitate to adjust max_batch_len and max_batch_len_val to fit your GPU's capabilities.
